# WideVine L3 Decryptor

This educational project was shut down because of a DMCA takedown request by Google on Nov. 9th, 2020.

We're reviving it in favor of what we can learn from this project, and the potential to build new file formats that **cannot** house DRM for a more open and free ecosystem in our world.

**NOTE:** As of this update to the README, this program _only works on Windows!_ We're planning on contributing to the original repo owner's work by adding compatibility with Linux and macOS systems soon.
