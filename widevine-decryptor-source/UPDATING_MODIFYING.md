# If you're an open-source geek...

...then you'll need to know some stuff before you can successfully modify or update the extension for your browser and/or a pull request with us.

**Let's get started.**


The source code we've put together can be modified at will. However, **you are not allowed to publish this extension** to any addon/extension store. You'll risk more DMCA takedowns, and we **will not accept anything from you after that**.  

We might have a problem with the tech companies, but we still care about security. For that reason, we're **not accepting already-compiled versions of the extensions.** We only accept the source code. 

**If you're going to install the precompiled Chrome extension,** you'll need to download the .pem file from our Releases page, too. If you don't and you load the extension without the private key file, **you won't be able to update your extension.**
